Revision 0.962 (Aug. 2021)
===================
* Maintenance fixes
* HRTF databases can be persistent between function calls
* Optional optimized absorption filter design
* Additional examples


Revision 0.95 (Mar. 2020, no public release)
===================
* Source directivity based on a simplified SHM based filter was added. 
  By this, some new options were introduced. See EXAMPLE_SOURCE_DIR.M for 
  details. 
* Fixed: Specific fix for the MK2 HRTF database search path and options. 
  op.hrtf_options.mk2_legacy_angle_conversion was added to default options.

Known issues:
-------------
* FDN channel mapping may introduce coloration effects in rooms with a very 
  short reverberation time.


Revision 0.94 (Dec. 2018, no public release)
===================
* Loudspeaker-array rendering is supported now! By this, some new options were
  introduced. See EXAMPLE_ARRAY.M for details and explanation.
* Most analysis tools support input of ir vector now.
* Different methods to specify room.materials can now be mixed for one room. See
  help razr or example_abscoeff.m for details.
* New function pink_pulse (to be used as analysis signal, e.g. as input for
  apply_rir). soundir provides now the option to directly listen to the pink
  filtered ir.
* HRTF data are stored as persistent variables now in order not to load them
  multiple times across calls of razr. They are only reloaded if
  op.hrtf_database or op.hrtf_options change, or if the new option
  op.force_loading_hrtf is set to true.
* Headphone equalization for Sennheiser HD650 added (see razr_cfg_default.m for
  details).
* FDN delays can now be passed directly as a vector if desired. The option
  fdn_mfactor was renamed to fdn_delay_stretch.
* [!] Enabled backwards compatibility to former versions:
  - If legacy options are detected, they are automatically translated to their
    corresponding new ones.
  - New functions "get_default_options_v<vers>" to run razr with the default
    options of a former version <vers>
  - RAZR's behavior from 2014 (status of JAES paper, see README) was fully
    restored, and the function "get_default_options_2014" to obtain the
    corresponding default options was completed and corrected.
* [!] The distance-depending sound attenuation is now strictly 1/distance for
  distance >= 1 meter. The smooth transition towards smaller distances was
  removed. The old behavior can be restored via op.legacy_distce_atten = 1.

Known issues:
-------------
* Absorption and reflection filters that are created internally might be
  instable if room.freq contains 125 Hz. Set the options op.plot_absFilters = 1
  and op.plot_reflFilters = 1 to check the created filters. In doubt, choose
  frequencies >= 250 Hz.


Revision 0.93 (Dec. 2017, no public release)
=========================
* Coupled rooms supported now. For details, see RAZR, EXAMPLE_COUPLED_ROOMS,
  GET_COUPLED_ROOMS.
* Improved documentation in several files.
* [!] Syntax for wall material specification. Now a colon ":" is used as
  separator, i.e., "dbase:material". The period symbol is not used longer to
  prevent confusion with "struct.field" syntax. For details, see help razr.


Revision 0.92 (Dec. 2017, no public release)
============================================
* [!] Fixed: Image source jitter is attenuated if it would cause an image source
  being closer to the receiver than the direct sound source.
* [!] op.ism_ISposRandFactor was replaced by op.ism_jitter_factor. Jittering now
  depends on ISM order instead of img src distance to receiver.
  op.ism_randFactorsInCart was renamed to op.ism_jitter_type and takes string
  values now.
* apply_rir: New parameters 'samples' and 'win'. See help apply_rir for details.
* schroeder_rt: plots EDC automatically if nargout == 0.
* [!] New handling of wall materials. Own databases for absorption coefficients
  can now be created and used. For syntax see help razr.
* [!] New handling of configuration. Several cfg files can be stored in parallel
  now. The function select_razr_cfg picks the desired one. See doc of
  "razr_cfg_default" and "select_razr_cfg" for details.
* The SOFA format (sofaconventions.org) for HRTFs is supported now.
* [!] New syntax for adding unsupported HRTF databases (non-SOFA format). See
  README for details.
* New functions: sop, smat. Search tools for option names and absorbing
  materials, respectively.
* ISM needs less memory now.
* [!] RIR length is now specified in samples instead of seconds. Therefore, the
  options "op.tlen" and "op.tlen_max" were replaced by new options "op.len" and
  "op.len_max", respectively.
* [!] The automatically chosen RIR length is now set to the maximum of
  the estimated T60 over frequencies instead of the doubled maximum. However,
  this behavior can be controlled using the new option "op.len_rt_factor".


Revision 0.91 (Apr. 2017)
=========================
* New function plot_ispos to plot image source positions
* The razr output "ism_data" now contains more fields
* scene:
    - Plots room even if srcpos/recpos/recdir are not existing
    - Colors of sources and receivers can now be specified
    - For multiple sources/receivers, labels have now the same color
    - Structure of returned handles is more clear now
* New function plot_freqrsp: Replaces plotFrqRsp
* Some code cleanup and refactoring.
* Some minor fixes
* schroeder_rt:
    - can plot the reverberation time against frequencies now
    - new option to plot the linear EDC fit
* [!] No random jitter on 1st-order img-src positions. New option to explicitly
  control that threshold order: op.ism_rand_start_order.


Revision 0.90 (Nov. 2016)
=========================
* New options for scene: hide_labels, labeloffset
* Disabled tone correction filter on direct sound
* Introduced spherical head model. The according new spat_mode 'shm' is now the
  default instead of 'ild'
* razr addpath/rmpath ignores .git folder now
* razr_cfg is now only created for razr addpath (not rmpath)
* "razr" is printed in lower case letters for razr short help
* apply_hrtf: replaced feval by eval for calling scripts (warning in older
  Matlab versions)


Revision 0.11 (Oct. 2016)
=========================
* Simpler folder structure
* Changed way of including unsupported HRTF databases (see README.txt)
* Multiple sound sources and receivers are supported now (see
  example_multiple_src.m). Updated analysis tools: scene, plot_ir, plot_irspec.
